# TASK 1.1
print("Hello World! is cool!")
# this is a single line comment
# this is also a single line comment
print("I am learning about comments")

"""
do not use this form of comments its bad practise
"""

#this line prints out hello world
# print("hello world")
#that was a useless comment

# Make sure comments are professional like this.
#dont say "this code is terrible!"




# TASK 1.2

print("Single line comments start with #")

# # print("Replace this line with TASK 1")

# print("Hello")
# print("World")
# print("with Comments")




# Objects and types!
# An int is an integer, this is a whole number, can be positive or negative
# A float is a decimal number
# A string (str) are normal words or letters. e.g Hello world is a string
# Booleans (bool) are using true and false to make decisions

#we can  use the type() function in python to figure out what class an object is. e.g
# n = type("hello")
# print(n)
#this returns "<class 'str>" which means the class is a string
# x = type(2.54)
# print(x)
#this tells us that the class is a float.

#we can do this in one line by doing thie following
# print(type(31))
#this returns an int

# TASK 1.3

print(type(12+5))
print(type(5 + 3.0))
print(type(12 / 5))
print(type(12 + 5 == 5 * 3.0))




# TASK 1.4

# You need to fix the following lines
# Run the code and then use the error messages to fix each line

# This line has a SyntaxError
print(hello world)

# This line has a NameError
printf("Hello World!")

# The following lines cause a TypeError
int1 = 100
str1 = "10"
print(int1 / str1)
